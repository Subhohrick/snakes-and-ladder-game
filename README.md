# snakes-and-ladder-game
Given a snake and ladder board game
find the minimum number of dice throws required to reach the destination or last cell from the source or 1st cell.
Basically, the player has total control over the outcome of the dice throw and wants to find out the minimum number of throws required to reach the last cell.
If the player reaches a cell which is the base of a ladder, the player has to climb up that ladder and if reaches a cell is the mouth of the snake, and has to go down to the tail of the snake without a dice throw.
I have used the Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm in grah BFS is a graph traversal approach in which we can start at a source node and layer by layer through the graph, analyzing the nodes directly related to the source node.
